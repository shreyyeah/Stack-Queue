# Stack-Queue
Stacks and queues may be implemented in C++ by utilising standard library containers and data structures. Two popular abstract data structures for organising groups of items with certain behaviours are stacks and queues.
What are stacks?
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means the last element added is the first one to be removed. There are two different ways to work with stack-
1. Using the c++ standard library
2. Using arrays or linked list

Queues- A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, which means the first element added is the first one to be removed. Ways to work with queues are pretty much the same as stacks. Though, Using the Standard Library containers like std::stack, std::queue, and std::priority_queue is often the most straightforward and efficient way to work with stacks, queues, and priority queues in C++.
